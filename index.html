        <h1>Reflection on Grid</h1>
        <h3>One thing i like about Grid..</h3>
        <p>what i really like about grid is that when we have to make and interactive website with a layout that contains multiple sections or say divs then placing them in the correct spot on the main Wrapper element becomes really easy and it is also much eaiser because the unit that we work with in the "fr" which makes it eaiser to map out all the elements so according to me making a website with alot of sections and divs and placing them in the correct spots is much easier with Grid so that's on thing i like about Css Grid.

        <h1>Reflection on Grid</h1>
        <h3>One thing i Dont like about Grid..</h3>
        <p>what i really dont like about Css Grid is that when we make really large websites and what i mean by that is a website with alot of content like carsouel, Moving animations and etc etc so when we have to place certain elements like these in the grid items then the alignments of those grid items and also putting them in the correct spots doesn't work out good and then the entire structure falls apart with flex box its opposite and it easier to place your content into stuff so that the only reason why i find Grid challenging.
